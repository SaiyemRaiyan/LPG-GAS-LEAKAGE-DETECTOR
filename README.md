# LPG-GAS-LEAKAGE-DETECTOR

  
                                                Problem Statement
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is widely used in households and industries due to its efficiency and convenience. However, LPG leaks pose significant safety risks, including the potential for explosions and health hazards. Detecting gas leaks early is crucial to prevent accidents and ensure the safety of occupants.

                                                    Solution
The project addresses this problem by developing an automated system to detect LPG leaks promptly. Utilizing an Arduino Uno microcontroller and an MQ series gas sensor, the system continuously monitors the air for LPG concentrations. The gas sensor library facilitates accurate data interpretation and sensor integration.

                                                System Overview
* Arduino Uno serves as the control unit.
Arduino UNO is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button.

* MQ series gas sensor detects LPG levels in the environment.
* Proteus software is used for designing and simulating the circuit.
* Gas sensor library provides essential functions for accurate gas concentration readings and system calibration.

  How does it work?
* Detection: The MQ gas sensor continuously measures the LPG concentration.
* Data Processing: The sensor outputs analog signals, which are processed by the Arduino using the gas sensor library to determine the exact gas concentration.
* Alert Mechanism: When LPG levels exceed a predefined threshold, the system triggers visual (LED) and auditory (buzzer) alarms to alert users of the leak.

By simulating the system in Proteus, the design and functionality can be tested and refined before deployment. This ensures that the LPG Gas Leakage Detector is providing an essential safety measure in environments where LPG is used.
